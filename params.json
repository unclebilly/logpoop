Print some poop in your terminals!","body":"= logpoop\r\n\r\nLogpoop has three poopy modes: \r\n== test\r\n  logpoop -t test [-d DIR]\r\nTest mode \"runs some unit tests\" in one terminal and \"tails some log file\" in another terminal.  Realistic! You are so busy running your tests!  \r\n== tail eff\r\n  logpoop [-d DIR]\r\nTail eff mode grabs a bunch of log files (either from a folder you specify or\r\nfrom /var/log) and simulates \"tail -f\" in all of your open terminals, while\r\nvarying the speed and intensity.  Whoa, don't bother me - I'm busy!  Move away, plebes.\r\n== poop\r\n  logpoop -t poop\r\nPrints a random ASCII poop in your terminal. OK, so this isn't so useful - but then, neither are you (right now).\r\n\r\n== Installation\r\n  [sudo] gem install logpoop\r\n \r\n== Help\r\n  logpoop --help\r\n  \r\n== Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2011 Billy Reisinger.
